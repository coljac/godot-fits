This code is a pre-alpha, but will be updated until I can put these up on the Godot asset library.

- An extension built with GDExtension, for reading in FITS files and handing WCS. (Status: working)
- A Godot node to display and work with FITS images (Status: rough and ready)
- DS9 region support (Status: partially working)
- Support for spectra/tables (Status: Not working yet)
